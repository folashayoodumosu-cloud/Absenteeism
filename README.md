# Absenteeism in the workplace.

This project is to provide a list of Healthy Individuals &amp; Low Absenteeism for a healthy bonus initiative within the budget of 1,000 USD
Human resources would also like for me to use said data to calculate a wage increase or annual compensation for non-smokers for:
 1) An insurance Budget of 983,221 USD for all Non-smokers
And create and present it all in a dashboard for greater interpretation.
